        <h2>Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis System</h2>
        <p>Sentiment Analysis (SA) is a natural language processing task that uses the computational approach to extract the opinionated content and classifies it as positive, negative or neutral. Generally, sentiment analysis can be performed at three levels, i.e., document, sentence and aspect level. This system focuses on aspect-based SA system for Hindi language.</p>
        <p>Aspect-based sentiment analysis helps to capture nuances about the objects of interest. As sometimes sentences may consist of different sentiments associated to different aspects of an entity and overall polarity of the sentence does not help to identify the absolute opinion of the writer. For example, consider the sentence, “The story of the movie is weak but music is good”. This sentence consists of negative (i.e., “weak”) and positive (i.e., “good”) sentiments about aspects “story” and “music”, respectively. </p>
